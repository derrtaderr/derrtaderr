# Hi there 👋 I'm Jason Derr

## AI Product Manager | Founder @ Templatiz

### 🔧 I'm currently working on:

* **Templatiz:** Architecting an AI-native Content OS that features **YOLO Mode**—a fully autonomous agentic loop that curates, personalizes, and publishes content without human intervention.
* **Magnetiz.ai:** Building private, containerized LLM infrastructure that lets enterprises ditch per-seat SaaS licenses for secure, local-first AI stacks.
* **EvalOS:** A production-grade evaluation framework with a 4-layer ML architecture for measuring content quality and hallucination rates.
* **Product Manager MCP:** Maintaining an open-source MCP server that integrates 50+ product frameworks directly into Claude/ChatGPT contexts.

### 🔬 I'm currently exploring:

* **Context-Aware RAG:** Engineering "Personalized Trending" engines that filter global noise through specific business context vectors (as seen in Templatiz).
* **Reasoning Models:** Optimizing chain-of-thought patterns (o1/DeepSeek) for complex agentic decision-making.
* **Small Language Models (SLMs):** Running high-performance, local-first inference for privacy-centric enterprise stacks.

### 💬 Ask me about:

* **The "Post-SaaS" Shift:** Why the future is Agentic Workflows (like YOLO Mode), not just Chatbots.
* **AI Validation:** How I use LangSmith and EvalOS to prevent the "80% failure rate" of AI projects.
* **Technical Implementation:** Next.js 14 App Router, Supabase Real-time, and n8n automations.
* **Strategy:** Bridging the gap between "cool demo" and "measurable business outcome."
